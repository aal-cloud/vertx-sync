= Synchronous but non-OS-thread-blocking verticles

*Love scalability?*

*Hate blocking kernel threads?*

*Hate callback hell?*

*Want to squash the pyramid of doom?*

*Well, now you can have your cake and eat it...*

Vertx-sync allows you to deploy verticles that run using *Fibers*. Fibers are very lightweight threads that can be
blocked without blocking a kernel thread.

This enables you to write your verticle code in a familiar synchronous style (i.e. no callbacks or promises or Rx).

As no kernel threads are blocked your application retains the scalability advantages of a non (kernel thread) blocking
application.

Please see the in source asciidoc documentation or the main documentation on the web-site for a full description
of vertx-sync
